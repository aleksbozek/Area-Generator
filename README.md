# Insta-Instance

**Description:**

This website will allow for the generation of map / area ideas.  The user decides what type of environment they wish to generate as well as how large of an area.  This will provide them with a rough guideline.  There will also be input fields for the user to add their own unique flavor into the random gen in case they have a theme to maintain.  Suitable for a broad creative audience seeking inspiration; from writers to digital artists!

**Wireframes:**
(currently drawing these)

**Component Heirarchy:**

A visual tree of your components, depicting the parent/child relationships, as well as an indication of which will be class components, requiring state, and which will be functional components, taking props.

**API:**

I plan on having at minimum two tables, one for storing finished generated locations as samples as well as another table to contain the generator options/attributes.

**Post-MVP:**
